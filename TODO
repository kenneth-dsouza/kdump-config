If you're interested in helping, here are some pending tasks.

==========================================================================

Include support for /etc/sysconfig/kdump under kdump-config.
Add remaining kdump.conf options(dracut_args, fence_kdump_args and core_collector)
Support inplace editing so we do not break the origin order of comments and config content.
